# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`.

This is a tool to help us manage versioning and changelogs with a focus on monorepos. You can find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## How to create a changeset

To create a new changeset, run:

```bash
npm run changeset
```

This will guide you through creating a changeset file that describes your changes.

## For Maintainers

When a PR is merged to the main branch:

1. The Release workflow creates a "Version Packages" PR with version bumps
2. When the Version PR is merged, packages are published to npm automatically

For more info, refer to our [Contributing Guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
